  description: >-
    Hey there! I’m Carly, owner & lead videographer at Wild Grace Video  based
    in Denver, Colorado.




    As a kid, I started by creating embarrassing horror movie trailers, which sparked my passion for video creation. Now, I thrive on crafting beautiful cinematic visuals and authentic stories for travel and adventure brands.




    I've always loved to capture the meaningful moments of my life on video. I've compiled adventures from my time abroad New Zealand, memories from my college years at University of Vermont, and captured staff moments at a Wyoming dude ranch during my summer job.




    Over the past five years, I've continued to do all of those things...just at a little bit more of a professional level. I’ve had the privilege of creating content for a diverse range of brands. 




    I enjoy the variety in the types of projects that I take on--from solo work to collaborative productions that create lasting impressions.




    Whatever type of creative assets your brand needs, I’m excited to produce the type of content that will help boost growth and leave an impact on your audience.




    Talk soon!


    ~Carly

    * I don’t drink coffee (matcha and chai all the way).

    * My friends make fun of me for pulling out the FlightRadar app every time I see an airplane so I can track where it’s going. 

    * I think about the universe way too much and how small we are on this little rock.

    * As a child I had a green pet duck named Patty and it would follow me around the yard.
