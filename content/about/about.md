  title: Meet **Carly.**
  description: >-
    I’m Carly, owner & lead videographer at Wild Grace Video, an outdoor and
    travel-related video production company based in Denver, Colorado.


    My journey into video production began with a simple desire: to capture and preserve the meaningful moments of my life. As I crafted video compilations of adventures that I refused to miss out on, I realized that I loved creating videos that told the story of new experiences. places, and people.


    Since then, I've been lucky enough to working with a variety of brands that share a love for the outdoors and travel. Now, I’m here to help your brand grow through video, translating your company's identity into a feeling that draws in an aligned audience.


    My goal is simple: help your brand forge meaningful connection with a like-minded community.


    I'm excited to meet you, discover what sets your brand apart, and to embark on this creative journey together.

  title: "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**"
  questions:
    - question: "**Do you offer both photo and video services?**"
      answer: We specialize in video production but can also offer photography
        services upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video
        production, captivating photography, or a combination of both, we're
        committed to meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to
        life.
    - question: "**What is the turnaround time?**"
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and we will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: "**How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?**"
      answer: We are adaptable to your preferences. Typically, we take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, we welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting us to handle the creative process,
        we're here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: "**Are we able to select the music for our video?**"
      answer: Typically, we curate music based on our expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. We have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, we value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, we're more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that we'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
