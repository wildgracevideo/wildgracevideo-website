  title: "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**"
  questions:
    - question: "**Do you do both photo and video?**"
      answer: I specialize in video production but can also offer photography services
        upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video production,
        captivating photography, or a combination of both, I’m committed to
        meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to life.
    - question: "**What is the turnaround time?**"
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and I will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: "**How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?**"
      answer: I am adaptable to your preferences. Typically, I take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, I welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting me to handle the creative process,
        I’m here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: "**Can we choose the music for our video?**"
      answer: Typically, I curate music based on my expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. I have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, I value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, I'm more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that I'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
