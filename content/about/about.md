      description: Everyone was selling the product...no one was sharing the
        inspiration, magic or feelings, and yet that was the content that I was
        drawn to most, and so were my client’s audiences.
    - title: "GAP #2"
      description: When businesses invested in high-impact videos, they often felt
        frustrated--their investment fell flat. The content clashed with videos
        from other teams, lacking cohesion.

    their vision, grew with them, and ensured every video elevated their brand.

  title: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
  questions:
    - question: What types of businesses do you work with?
      answer: I work primarily with boutique hotels, outdoor brands and adventure tour
        companies. I also have extensive experience working with service-based
        companies that value high-quality storytelling and a strong visual
        identity.
    - question: How do I know what kind of video I need?
      answer: >-
        Most clients come to me knowing they need video, but not always
        sure *what* kind. That’s completely normal.


        In our initial Discovery Call, I'll ask you specific questions about your business and goals. From there, I can recommend the right video types and strategy to help you achieve those goals
    - question: Do you offer packages or custom pricing?
      answer: >-
        Yes, both. I offer [quarterly content
        packages](https://www.wildgracevideo.com/services)[](https://www.wildgracevideo.com/services) for
        brands that want to put out ongoing social content, seasonal campaigns,
        or regular product launches. I offer custom proposals for one-off
        projects like brand films, commercials, or larger campaigns.


        If you’re not sure which is right, I’ll help you choose the most effective option for your budget and goals.
    - question: How much does professional video typically cost?
      answer: >-
        Professional video production pricing varies based on deliverables,
        day-of production needs, and usage. Most of my client's projects fall
        within a $5k–$10k investment range.


        After a 30-min Discovery Call, I'll deliver a clear, transparent proposal within 24-48 hours.
    - question: When will I receive the final video(s)?
      answer: >-
        Timelines vary by project, but most videos are delivered within 2–3
        weeks after filming. This includes editing, color grading, and sound
        design.


        If you have a specific deadline (launch, event, campaign), I’ll build the timeline around that and discuss any expedited options upfront.
    - question: Where are you located, and do you travel?
      answer: I am based in Denver, Colorado and available for projects statewide,
        nationwide, and internationally.
    - question: What's the first step to get started?
      answer: >-
        The first step is to book your 30-min Discovery Call. This allows me to
        learn more about your business, goals, and timeline. From there, I’ll
        deliver a proposal for your review within 24-48 hours.
