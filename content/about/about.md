      description: Everyone was selling the product...no one was sharing the
        inspiration, magic or feelings, and yet that was the content that I was
        drawn to most, and so were my client’s audiences.
    - title: "GAP #2"
      description: When businesses invested in high-impact videos, they often felt
        frustrated--their investment fell flat. The content clashed with videos
        from other teams, lacking cohesion.

  title: "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**"
  questions:
    - question: "**Do you offer both photo and video services?**"
      answer: We specialize in video production but can also offer photography
        services upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video
        production, captivating photography, or a combination of both, we're
        committed to meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to
        life.
    - question: "**What is the turnaround time?**"
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and we will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: "**How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?**"
      answer: We are adaptable to your preferences. Typically, we take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, we welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting us to handle the creative process,
        we're here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: "**Are we able to select the music for our video?**"
      answer: Typically, we curate music based on our expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. We have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, we value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, we're more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that we'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
