aboutMe:
  title: "Adventure brands: **it’s time to differentiate yourselves.**"
  description: >-
    I’m Carly, owner & lead videographer at Wild Grace Video Productions based
    in Denver, Colorado.




    My journey into videography began with a simple desire: to capture and preserve the meaningful moments of my life. As I crafted a video compilation of the adventures I refused to miss out on in New Zealand, wove together college memories for my friends post-graduation from the University of Vermont, and captured the new setting and faces of a fun summer job at a dude ranch in Wyoming, I realized that I loved creating videos that told the story of adventures, people, and new places.




    Over the past five years, I've had the privilege of creating content for a diverse range of brands. However I found myself staying up editing until 2 in the morning (by choice!) for those brands that featured outdoor adventure and wanted to get across a deeper meaning than just selling a product or service—they wanted to create a feeling that attracted a certain type of person and community towards the brand. This is what I found spoke to both me and viewers, and what really sets a brand apart from creating just another cool adventure video with a product.




    With each project I've created I've found myself diving into every detail of the creative process. From fine-tuning the sounds of a crashing wave to sculpting the vivid color palettes of a mountain scene that shaped the mood and atmosphere.




    And now, I'm here to lend my expertise to you. My goal is simple: to help your brand forge meaningful connections with a like-minded community. 




    I'm excited to meet you, to discover what sets your brand apart, and to embark on this creative journey together.

  title: "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**"
  questions:
    - question: "**Do you do both photo and video?**"
      answer: I specialize in video production but can also offer photography services
        upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video production,
        captivating photography, or a combination of both, I’m committed to
        meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to life.
    - question: "**What is the turnaround time?**"
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and I will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: "**How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?**"
      answer: I am adaptable to your preferences. Typically, I take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, I welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting me to handle the creative process,
        I’m here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: "**Can we choose the music for our video?**"
      answer: Typically, I curate music based on my expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. I have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, I value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, I'm more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that I'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
aboutMeDescription: >-
  I'm Carly, and creating videos is my thing. After graduating from the
  University of Vermont (Go Catamounts!) I made the decision to pack my bags and
  fly out west—and now call Denver, Colorado my home.




  Ever since I was younger, I have always found passion and excitement through creating videos. From creating embarrassing movie trailers with my friends when I was younger, to putting together creative travel videos from my semester abroad in New Zealand, and compiling footage of the ranch I worked at in Wyoming. Creating travel and outdoor videos as a “souvenir” from moments through life has always been important to me.




  At Wild Grace Video Productions, I am focused on providing detailed and personalized videos to match your brand and relay your message in a professional, yet exciting style.




  I feel beyond fortunate that I have been able to combine my love for creativity and video into my own business and I’m excited to share that same energy and excitement with you.
