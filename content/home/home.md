  title: MEET YOUR ADVENTURE-LOVING FOUNDER & CINEMATOGRAPHER.
  description: >-
    Hey, I’m Carly! My journey into this all started pretty casually, making fun
    videos of my travels as keepsakes for me and my friends.


    I quickly realized I felt at home in these moments, capturing stories of adventures, people, and new places. I started working for an agency but left to pursue work in my niche - the outdoor space.


    I love to travel, ski, and go to Red Rocks concerts, but there’s some more I’d love to share about myself behind the scenes...

faq:
  title: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
  questions:
    - question: Do you offer both video and photo services?
      answer: Yes. while my primary focus is video production, I also offer
        professional photography as an add-on service. This is ideal for brands
        that need both video content and high-quality images for their website,
        social media, and marketing materials.
    - question: How much does a video project cost?
      answer: Pricing depends on the scope of the project, the number of videos, and
        the complexity of the shoot. I offer quarterly retainer options, one-off
        packages, and consulting to fit different business needs. View the
        Services Page for my starting at rates.
    - question: How long does the video production process take?
      answer: |-
        The timeline varies based on the project, but typically:


        Strategy Consult: 1 week
        Pre-production: 1 week
        Filming: 1-2 days (depending on scope)
        Editing: 1-2 weeks


        I’ll provide a clear timeline once we understand your project needs.
    - question: Do you travel for shoots?
      answer: Yes! I’m based in Denver, CO, but I work with brands across the U.S. and
        internationally. Travel fees may apply for locations outside the
        standard service area.
    - question: Do you offer monthly or quarterly content packages?
      answer: Yes, I offer ongoing content creation packages for brands that need
        fresh video content every month. The shoots take place once per quarter,
        but enough content is captured during those shoots and are delivered
        strategically every month. This is ideal for brands looking to build a
        consistent social media presence. Check out my quarterly packages within
        the Adventure Content Partnership here.

aboutMeDescription: >-
  I'm Carly, and creating videos is my thing. After graduating from the
  University of Vermont (Go Catamounts!) I made the decision to pack my bags and
  fly out west—and now call Denver, Colorado my home.




  Ever since I was younger, I have always found passion and excitement through creating videos. From creating embarrassing movie trailers with my friends when I was younger, to putting together creative travel videos from my semester abroad in New Zealand, and compiling footage of the ranch I worked at in Wyoming. Creating travel and outdoor videos as a “souvenir” from moments through life has always been important to me.




  At Wild Grace Video Productions, I am focused on providing detailed and personalized videos to match your brand and relay your message in a professional, yet exciting style.




  I feel beyond fortunate that I have been able to combine my love for creativity and video into my own business and I’m excited to share that same energy and excitement with you.
