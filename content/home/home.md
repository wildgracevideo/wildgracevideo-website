  description: >-
    Hey, I’m Carly! My journey into this all started pretty casually, making fun
    videos of my travels as keepsakes for me and my friends.


    I quickly realized I felt at home in these moments, capturing stories of adventures, people, and new places. I started working for an agency but left to pursue work in my niche - the outdoor space.


    I love to travel, ski, and go to Red Rocks concerts, but there’s some more I’d love to share about myself behind the scenes...

  title: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
  questions:
    - question: Do you offer both photo and video services??
      answer: We specialize in video production but can also offer photography
        services upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video
        production, captivating photography, or a combination of both, we’re
        committed to meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to
        life.
    - question: What is the turnaround time?
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and we will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?
      answer: We are adaptable to your preferences. Typically, we take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, we welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting us to handle the creative process,
        we're here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: Are we able to select the music for our video?
      answer: Typically, we curate music based on our expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. We have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, we value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, we're more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that we'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
aboutMeDescription: >-
  I'm Carly, and creating videos is my thing. After graduating from the
  University of Vermont (Go Catamounts!) I made the decision to pack my bags and
  fly out west—and now call Denver, Colorado my home.




  Ever since I was younger, I have always found passion and excitement through creating videos. From creating embarrassing movie trailers with my friends when I was younger, to putting together creative travel videos from my semester abroad in New Zealand, and compiling footage of the ranch I worked at in Wyoming. Creating travel and outdoor videos as a “souvenir” from moments through life has always been important to me.




  At Wild Grace Video Productions, I am focused on providing detailed and personalized videos to match your brand and relay your message in a professional, yet exciting style.




  I feel beyond fortunate that I have been able to combine my love for creativity and video into my own business and I’m excited to share that same energy and excitement with you.
