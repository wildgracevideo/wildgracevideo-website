aboutMe:
  title: MEET YOUR **ADVENTURE-LOVING VIDEOGRAPHER.**
  description: >-
    I'm Carly, and creating videos is my thing. After graduating from the
    University of Vermont (Go Catamounts!) I made the decision to pack my bags
    and fly out west—and now call Denver, Colorado my home.




    Ever since I was younger, I have always found passion and excitement through creating videos. From creating embarrassing movie trailers with my friends when I was younger, to putting together creative travel videos from my semester abroad in New Zealand, and compiling footage of the ranch I worked at in Wyoming. Creating travel and outdoor videos as a “souvenir” from moments through life has always been important to me.




    At Wild Grace Video Productions, I am focused on providing detailed and personalized videos to match your brand and relay your message in a professional, yet exciting style.




    I feel beyond fortunate that I have been able to combine my love for creativity and video into my own business and I’m excited to share that same energy and excitement with you.

testimonialQuotes:
  - quote: Carly was so great to work with! She exceeded my expectations with
      bringing my vision to life and delivering an epic video for our brand. She
      listened to every detail I wanted to be included, and took creative
      responsibility during the shoots to ensure she had everything she needed.
      When I received the final work I had to watch it 5x in a row because it
      was that good. Highly recommend her for your cinematic needs!
    author: Lauren Klein, Genesee Nutrition
  - quote: Carly has great energy and enthusiasm, combined with maturity, knowledge
      and skill in her field of work. The final product was very impressive and
      exceeded our expectations.

faq:
  title: "**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**"
  questions:
    - question: "**Do you do both photo and video?**"
      answer: I specialize in video production but can also offer photography services
        upon request. Whether you're seeking a stunning video production,
        captivating photography, or a combination of both, I’m committed to
        meeting your creative needs and bringing your vision to life.
    - question: "**What is the turnaround time?**"
      answer: Turnaround time varies based on the project scope and I will provide an
        estimated timeline during the Discovery Call. However, the majority of
        our projects have a 2-week turnaround time from the last shoot date.
    - question: "**How involved are you in the planning and storyboarding process?**"
      answer: I am adaptable to your preferences. Typically, I take the lead in
        planning and storyboarding based on the insights gathered during our
        discovery call and pre-production meeting. However, I welcome your
        involvement at any level—whether you prefer a hands-on approach in
        planning every detail or entrusting me to handle the creative process,
        I’m here to accommodate your needs and vision.
    - question: "**Can we choose the music for our video?**"
      answer: Typically, I curate music based on my expertise and the flow of the
        editing process. I have access to a wide range of quality, royalty-free
        tracks from a subscription platform. However, I value your preferences.
        If you have specific genre ideas or would like to be presented with song
        options, I'm more than happy to provide you with a selection to choose
        from. Otherwise, rest assured that I'll select music that complements
        the video seamlessly, drawing from my experience and creative instincts
        which have been successful in past projects.
