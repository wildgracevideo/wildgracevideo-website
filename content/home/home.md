aboutMe:
  title: MEET YOUR **ADVENTURE-LOVING VIDEOGRAPHER.**
  description: >-
    I'm Carly, and creating videos is my thing. After graduating from the
    University of Vermont (Go Catamounts!) I made the decision to pack my bags
    and fly out west—and now call Denver, Colorado my home.




    Ever since I was younger, I have always found passion and excitement through creating videos. From creating embarrassing movie trailers with my friends when I was younger, to putting together creative travel videos from my semester abroad in New Zealand, and compiling footage of the ranch I worked at in Wyoming. Creating travel and outdoor videos as a “souvenir” from moments through life has always been important to me.




    At Wild Grace Video Productions, I am focused on providing detailed and personalized videos to match your brand and relay your message in a professional, yet exciting style.




    I feel beyond fortunate that I have been able to combine my love for creativity and video into my own business and I’m excited to share that same energy and excitement with you.

testimonialQuotes:
  - quote: Carly was so great to work with! She exceeded my expectations with
      bringing my vision to life and delivering an epic video for our brand. She
      listened to every detail I wanted to be included, and took creative
      responsibility during the shoots to ensure she had everything she needed.
      When I received the final work I had to watch it 5x in a row because it
      was that good. Highly recommend her for your cinematic needs!
    author: Lauren Klein, Genesee Nutrition
  - quote: Carly has great energy and enthusiasm, combined with maturity, knowledge
      and skill in her field of work. The final product was very impressive and
      exceeded our expectations.
