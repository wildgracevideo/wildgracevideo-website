  - quote: Unfortunately, our stock is somehow not well understood by the markets.
      The market compares us with generic companies. We need to look at Biocon
      as a bellwether stock. A stock that is differentiated, a stock that is
      focused on R&D, and a very, very strong balance sheet with huge value
      drivers at the end of it.

  - quote: Certainly the caffeine in coffee, whether it's Starbucks or generic
      coffee, is somewhat of a stimulant. But if you drink it in moderation,
      which I think four or five cups a day is, you're fine.
